# PythonCrashCourseProjects
Join me on my journey through the Python Crash Course 2nd Edition by Matthes!

I've decided I wanted to learn Python as it's quickly becoming a forerunner amongst programming languages! My hope is to utilize it in backend programming for websites. I plan to go through all exercises contained in this book over the next few months and will commit them on here.
